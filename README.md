# SVmods temporary location
### Wait, what?
There was an old explanition here with something around my main account being suspended, and me having this be low effort so I can move these mods there later. However, it looks like somewhere in the future, mods *might* migrate to either the steam workshop or thunderstore.

To install and use these mods, you will need the latest nightly version of Melonloader and the SVModHelper (currently dependant on v0.2.2).

The instructions are better explained on the wiki of the SVModHelper.

Here is a list of mods together with a basic descriptor of some key function(s) and some example cards & artifacts:
## Astronomy pack
A pack of cards and artifacts revolving around *Stars*: You want to earn more? You want to spend them? **Starcycle** is here to spend stars if you have enough, otherwise you'll earn them. Here is a small sample of the pack:
#### Photonic Gift, Card
1 cost rare, Give a **Shield** to a **Shield**-less invader and gain 2500 **Stars**. Purge this card.
#### Consentrate, Card
1 cost common, **Starcycle** 1000. On spend, strike a tile within 3 range, 2 times.

## History pack
A pack of cards and artifacts revolving around even more artifacts: You need more artifacts? Why don't you make some temporary ones mid-encounter using **Relics**! **Relics** may be weak, but strength comes in numbers! Here is a small sample of the pack:
#### Archeology, Card
1 cost rare, Gain a **Relic** and strike your mech. Purge this card.
#### Revolution, Card
1 cost common, Move 1 to 4 tiles. If you have 10 or more artifacts, reduce the cost of the next card you play by 1.
#### Steam Engine, Artifact
Common, At the end of turns 1 and 3, gain a **Relic**.
#### Grenade, Relic
When your turn ends, 50% chance to strike a random invader.

### And another pack in the future surrounding discounts... (and probably more after that)

### A quick note
The History Pack involves a new mechanic, making it feel very weird in comparison to vanilla packs, as those build upon existing mechanics. If you're seeking for the same experience as vanilla but with more content, History Pack might *not* be the way. Also, since we are talking about the History Pack anyways, this pack has not been tested as extensively as any other packs I made, this means that some of the cards/artifacts are a tad bit too strong (or way too strong). The same may apply to any other cards/artifact from other mods here.

If you want to download any of the mods, you can download the .dll files in the latest release. You can also download a .zip file of the code if you want to see how it is done (comments *are* included). View the latest release on the right side of the site for the files.

If you have any feedback, issues, or notes, feel free to tell me.
