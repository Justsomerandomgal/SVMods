# SVmods temporary location
### Wait, what?
Github just really enjoyed suspending my main account, so I'm now using an alt-account to publish this with some bare bones instructions (when I get my account back this will look better I swear)

To install and use the mod, you will need the latest nightly version of Melonloader and the SVModHelper (current highest known compatibility: v0.2.1)

The instructions are better explained on the wiki of the SVModHelper

For now, you can download the .dll files for the astronomy pack, a pack of cards and artifacts revolving around *stars*. You can also download a .zip file of the code if you want to see how it is done (comments *are* included).
